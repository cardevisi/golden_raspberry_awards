# :: Golden Raspberry Award ::

This project is part of a technical challenge for a position as a front-end enginner. Bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Problems with environment? Intructions here [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

After you clone the **golden_raspbarry_awards** from this repository. Access the root of application **golden_raspbarry_awards** Ex. cd golden_raspbarry_awards.

Start Metro, running the following command from the _root_ of your Golden Raspberry Awards application:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the Golden Raspberry Awards project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the Golden Raspberry Awards app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
